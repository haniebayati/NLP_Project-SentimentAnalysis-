Stayed in January 2025,"The room was very small. It was smaller than most hotel rooms where I have stayed with Ibis. There was not much natural light either.  It felt a bit boxed in. I think most of the rooms are very small in this hotel. My impression was that they had renovated the building and had made as many rooms as they could. Like many modern hotels, you can't open the window to get fresh air, which I found frustrating. I could not turn down the temperature past 18 centigrades.The location is perfect. It is close to the major attractions as well as the train station. The staff was super welcoming and flexible. They allowed me to check in a bit earlier at no extra charge and were patient with the explanations about the place. The room was well-decorated and very clean. There was a lovely kettle with tea, coffee, and cookies in the room. There was a nice shower in the bathroom. The breakfast which is included was amazing!! 5 stars out of 5. It easily can be a brunch because they have a wide array of pastries, cereals, cold cuts, and drinks.Stayed in January 2025",Brett,8.0

Breakfast was good and I looked forward to it every day.  The location of the hotel exceeded my expectations.  All of the major sites were either within walking distance or a very short drive by Uber, taxi, bus, or light rail.  I have bad knees, but I still made it around the city just fine.  So much history and so much to see.  We spent 10 days in Scotland and enjoyed every minute.  Thank you Ibis St Andrews.Stayed in September 2024",Michael,10

Was not sure about continental breakfast, but it was absolutely beautiful. We tried food we had never tasted before, and it was lovely and fresh. The bedroom was beautiful and clean, and it was lovely to come back from our day to find that the housekeeper has been in and empty our bins and topped our tea and milk up along with making the bed properly. It was also very nice that we could leave our suitcase at the hotel while we finished our last day in style by visiting the beautiful Edinburgh Castle. It would have been so hard if we were to cart a suitcase and bags about.  Thank you, Ibis, and we will see you next year.

When we got back to Edinburgh for our last night in Scotland after a 5-day trip to Orkney, we were surprised by an upgrade to a top-floor suite with a pull-out in the living room and a double bed in the bedroom. We also had a balcony which would have been very pleasant had we been there longer than just the one night. The staff was kind enough to pack us some fruit, croissants and pastries and left them for us at reception when we left to get the 5:40am tram.

When we arrived to check in the lady on reception (sorry I didn't catch the name) was very friendly, pleasant and helpful, in fact all the staff we came into contact with were all exceptional. The hotel is in an ideal location only minutes from all the main attractions and restaurants and bars the city has to offer. The food choices were fantastic and at a great price and the breakfast selection catered for every need and was all fresh and tasty. Having stayed in many of Edinburgh's hotels previously I have now found my must stay at hotel for any future visits. 5 star rating from me!Stayed in October 2023",Mg*,10

Stayed in April 2024,"No food available the evening I stayed.
The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.  Surely a fire door is also for smoke prevention and allows safety for those in the room in case of fire, especially since the main staircase was the only exit.
Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.
My preference is for a showerhead which can be handheld not just an overhead fixed shower.Staff were great and cleanliness was good overall.
Breakfast was brilliant.Stayed in April 2024",Nicola,7.0
Stayed in May 2024,"The room was very hot, although it was not a particularly warm day. If the temperature hit mid 20's, it would be utterly unbearable.  If staff pulled down the blind in the room prior to our arrival, and closed the window, it would certainly have helped.
I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler 
Breakfast was plentiful, if a little slow in coming and was tasty apart from a strange nearly raw  large tomato on the plate!

I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler 
Breakfast was plentiful, if a little slow in coming and was tasty apart from a strange nearly raw  large tomato on the plate!

The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.  Surely a fire door is also for smoke prevention and allows safety for those in the room in case of fire, especially since the main staircase was the only exit.
Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.

I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler 
Breakfast was plentiful, if a little slow in coming and was tasty apart from a strange nearly raw  large tomato on the plate!

The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.

Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.

I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler

The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.  Surely a fire door is also for smoke prevention and allows safety for those in the room in case of fire, especially since the main staircase was the only exit.
Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.

I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler

The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.

Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.

I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler 
Breakfast was plentiful, if a little slow in coming and was tasty apart from a strange nearly raw  large tomato on the plate!

Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.

Stayed in April 2024,"No food available the evening I stayed.
The main door for my room (top floor) was a designated fire door but I could see the light from the landing through a gap all the way round it which I am not sure is right.  Surely a fire door is also for smoke prevention and allows safety for those in the room in case of fire, especially since the main staircase was the only exit.
Some random wires above the mirror in the bathroom and a stain on one of the bedcovers as well as the bathroom mirror light not working were things which I would not have expected in a high quality room.
My preference is for a showerhead which can be handheld not just an overhead fixed shower.Staff were great and cleanliness was good overall.
Breakfast was brilliant.Stayed in April 2024",Nicola,7.0
Stayed in May 2024,"The room was very hot, although it was not a particularly warm day. If the temperature hit mid 20's, it would be utterly unbearable.  If staff pulled down the blind in the room prior to our arrival, and closed the window, it would certainly have helped.
I think the biggest issue that I should flag is the stairs. Some people would really struggle with this. I certainly didn't notice it when booking. Four rooms are on the first floor-17 stairs I think, and our room and one more at the top meant 34 stairs. My husband does have a slight knee issue...
One other point to note is that food is unavailable on Mondays.Nice sized room in a quiet location. The room was quite clean and comfortable. Toiletries were provided, as was tea and coffee, although UHT milk seems to be the norm now which my husband won't drink, and it did feel a little rashioned. Biscuits were a nice addition.
A basic fan was provided. This turned out to be essential, as it was a warm sunny day, and our room was in the attic space. One of the 2 windows had a blind, but unfortunately the staff didn't think to pull it down which would have kept the room cooler 
Breakfast was plentiful, if a little slow in coming and was tasty apart from a strange nearly raw  large tomato on the plate!
The bar area was spacious, and there is a narrow balcony outside with views across the golf course.  There are quite a few stairs here too, but also a small lift which is really helpful.Stayed in May 2024",Lynn,7.0

The track to the golf course and accommodation wasn't very clearly marked so arriving at night is a bit daunting, again these would be cheap and easy to remedy.Room and Breakfast were good.

Stayed in February 2025,"Booked an accessible room. The bathing stool supplied was unsafe and clearly hadn't been recently checked. Took it to reception, it was not replaced. 
Room 23 is apparently the largest of the 2 accessible rooms they have. Being the only one with a double bed (room also included a single). But being wedged between the breakfast room one side and the bin store out the window meant that the room was rather noisy from 6am on and the light directly outside the window was never turned off. 
There is a third 'accessible' room with an accessible bathroom and a double bed. That we may request if we return. It's just not listed as accessible as it has a step down. So bad for wheelchairs.Good location, decent breakfast. Incredibly helpful and cheerful receptionist (I've forgotten her name but she's from Dorchester).Stayed in February 2025",Rachael,7.0

Stayed in February 2025,We are non smokers so found that other  guests smoking just outside the front door and putting snubs out on the floor a bit off putting. Besides that the hotel is fine.

There  is a no smoking rule in the hotel, but one time I came back to the hotel, the person who checked me in was standing chatting to the new person on shiift behind the desk.

I paid for early check in, never got the bed size I booked online but single double beds which were quiet tiny. I ended up paying almost above what I would have paid for better comfort.

Stayed in January 2025,"While my stay at the Crowne Plaza London was mostly positive, there were a couple of things I didn't love. For one, the room felt a bit on the warmer side, even with the AC on, which made it slightly uncomfortable during the night. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

Stayed in January 2025,"While my stay at the Crowne Plaza London was mostly positive, there were a couple of things I didn't love. For one, the room felt a bit on the warmer side, even with the AC on, which made it slightly uncomfortable during the night. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

Stayed in January 2025,"While my stay at the Crowne Plaza London was mostly positive, there were a couple of things I didn't love. For one, the room felt a bit on the warmer side, even with the AC on, which made it slightly uncomfortable during the night. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

Stayed in January 2025,"While my stay at the Crowne Plaza London was mostly positive, there were a couple of things I didn't love. For one, the room felt a bit on the warmer side, even with the AC on, which made it slightly uncomfortable during the night. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

Stayed in January 2025,"While my stay at the Crowne Plaza London was mostly positive, there were a couple of things I didn't love. For one, the room felt a bit on the warmer side, even with the AC on, which made it slightly uncomfortable during the night. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it did make it harder to sleep soundly.Also, while the breakfast spread was great, the wait for a table during peak hours could sometimes be a bit long, especially on busy mornings. A little more seating space or faster turnover would have made the experience smoother.That said, these were fairly minor inconveniences, and overall, it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of my stay.I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza London! The room was spacious, modern, and very comfortable, with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing stay, like a flat-screen TV, a cozy bed, and a work desk. The bathroom was also spotless, with a walk-in shower that felt very luxurious.As for the location, it's fantastic! It's close to public transport, with a few tube stations within walking distance, which makes getting around the city a breeze. The area is also filled with great restaurants, cafes, and shops, so there's always something to do nearby.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Crowne Plaza London – it’s a great choice for both comfort and convenience!Stayed in January 2025",Chris,9.0

When you first enter there is an ambience that is difficult to describe but it has a lot to do with the lighting, the facilities, the décor and the layout as well as a wonderful team of friendly and helpful staff who go above and beyond to make everything perfect for your stay. The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests. He even played connect four with us and began pouring drinks for us before they were even ordered just because we were waiting at the bar and he knew what we wanted! An unforgettable stay.

When you first enter there is an ambience that is difficult to describe but it has a lot to do with the lighting, the facilities, the décor and the layout as well as a wonderful team of friendly and helpful staff who go above and beyond to make everything perfect for your stay. The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests.

The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests. He even played connect four with us and began pouring drinks for us before they were even ordered just because we were waiting at the bar and he knew what we wanted! An unforgettable stay.

When you first enter there is an ambience that is difficult to describe but it has a lot to do with the lighting, the facilities, the décor and the layout as well as a wonderful team of friendly and helpful staff who go above and beyond to make everything perfect for your stay. The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests.

When you first enter there is an ambience that is difficult to describe but it has a lot to do with the lighting, the facilities, the décor and the layout as well as a wonderful team of friendly and helpful staff who go above and beyond to make everything perfect for your stay. The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests.

Stayed in February 2025,"The only suggestion I have is that there could be one or two more lager on tap options at the bar, but I am clutching at straws there and the cocktails were fabulous!Everything about the Moxy Hotel is exceptional. When you first enter there is an ambience that is difficult to describe but it has a lot to do with the lighting, the facilities, the décor and the layout as well as a wonderful team of friendly and helpful staff who go above and beyond to make everything perfect for your stay. The hotel facilities are first rate, the place is spotlessly clean and the food from the bar menu was delicious. The buffet breakfast has a huge range of options and caters for all. The lighting in the rooms is wonderful and the floor to ceiling black out curtains make for a lovely restful sleep. Check out time of 12pm and breakfast till 11, make it that bit above and beyond what you would normally expect. We were even allowed to check in early too. Special thanks to Ala one of the team leaders who looked after us as though we were his only guests. He even played connect four with us and began pouring drinks for us before they were even ordered just because we were waiting at the bar and he knew what we wanted! An unforgettable stay. We will be back!Stayed in February 2025",Amanda,10

We didn't expect it to be too varied, but wow, there was lots on offer and all delicious! Location for us was perfect as it's close to the train station.

You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait.

Stayed in February 2025,"The breakfast space felt a bit overcrowded and hard to get through the food because they are placed on a narrow bar counter. If there are 5 people on the queue or more guest coming down, which happened that day they all have to wait for that 1 person to finish gathering their food as the space is very tight and narrow. You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait. The breakfast area is also the lounge area so if everyone booked breakfast included its a small space to accomodate everyone.

Stayed in February 2025,"The breakfast space felt a bit overcrowded and hard to get through the food because they are placed on a narrow bar counter. If there are 5 people on the queue or more guest coming down, which happened that day they all have to wait for that 1 person to finish gathering their food as the space is very tight and narrow. You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait. The breakfast area is also the lounge area so if everyone booked breakfast included its a small space to accomodate everyone.

If there are 5 people on the queue or more guest coming down, which happened that day they all have to wait for that 1 person to finish gathering their food as the space is very tight and narrow. You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait. The breakfast area is also the lounge area so if everyone booked breakfast included its a small space to accomodate everyone.

Stayed in February 2025,"The breakfast space felt a bit overcrowded and hard to get through the food because they are placed on a narrow bar counter. If there are 5 people on the queue or more guest coming down, which happened that day they all have to wait for that 1 person to finish gathering their food as the space is very tight and narrow. You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait. The breakfast area is also the lounge area so if everyone booked breakfast included its a small space to accomodate everyone.

Stayed in February 2025,"The breakfast space felt a bit overcrowded and hard to get through the food because they are placed on a narrow bar counter. If there are 5 people on the queue or more guest coming down, which happened that day they all have to wait for that 1 person to finish gathering their food as the space is very tight and narrow. You can easily bump to one another. Also, 1 person staff only accomodating and doing all the preparation and taking orders from all the customers coming. Some people have to wait really long until she finishes serving each and everyone by herself. She did very well but I think if customers needs to rush to go somewhere and are just waiting for their plates or hot drinks to come it would be a long wait. The breakfast area is also the lounge area so if everyone booked breakfast included its a small space to accomodate everyone.
