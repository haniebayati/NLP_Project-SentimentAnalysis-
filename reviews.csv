The central locations usually could be so much noisy but this location not noisy because behind the Princess Street. The room was small but it was fine to spend two nights as most of the time of the travel is spent discovering the city so outside the room.

Loved the breakfast which was delicious, and also the free sweeties and lollies available at reception. Also enjoyed the live musician in the evening.

Was not sure about continental breakfast, but it was absolutely beautiful. We tried food we had never tasted before, and it was lovely and fresh. The bedroom was beautiful and clean, and it was lovely to come back from our day to find that the housekeeper has been in and empty our bins and topped our tea and milk up along with making the bed properly. It was also very nice that we could leave our suitcase at the hotel while we finished our last day in style by visiting the beautiful Edinburgh Castle. It would have been so hard if we were to cart a suitcase and bags about.  Thank you, Ibis, and we will see you next year.

The room we had during the first few days of our stay was compact, but very clean and provided all we needed for our time there. The continental breakfast provided was varied and tasty. When we got back to Edinburgh for our last night in Scotland after a 5-day trip to Orkney, we were surprised by an upgrade to a top-floor suite with a pull-out in the living room and a double bed in the bedroom. We also had a balcony which would have been very pleasant had we been there longer than just the one night.

When we arrived to check in the lady on reception (sorry I didn't catch the name) was very friendly, pleasant and helpful, in fact all the staff we came into contact with were all exceptional. The hotel is in an ideal location only minutes from all the main attractions and restaurants and bars the city has to offer. The food choices were fantastic and at a great price and the breakfast selection catered for every need and was all fresh and tasty. Having stayed in many of Edinburgh's hotels previously I have now found my must stay at hotel for any future visits. 5 star rating from me!Stayed in October 2023",Mg*,10

Bed wasn’t the most comfortable.The breakfast was excellent. Husband would have liked fried eggs but you can’t please everyone. Huge amount of choice.Staff were all very friendly and helpful.Location is excellent for accessing public transport and key locations of the city. Plenty of restaurants around.Bar was nice to have in the hotel and live music on Thursday was very good. Nice view of St Andrews square from room. Shower lovely. Room very nicely decorated.Stayed in March 2022",Kayleigh,9.0

The breakfast was really nice just really unorganised, both days we went down for it we were waiting around for forks because they'd run out and no one had topped then up and we weren't the only ones their was quite a few other guests waiting too.The hotel is in an amazing location, its 5-10 min walk from Edinburgh Waverley, its close to the shops, restaurants, tour bus pick up and drop off locations.

Stayed in February 2022,"Wonderful hotel and lovely staff, especially Amber who was very welcoming, had our room ready early and had great knowledge of the area. We booked a balcony room which was very spacious, comfy, modern and spotlessly clean with Scottish decor. The breakfast on offer was delicious from hot food (sausage, bacon, beans, eggs) to cereal, parties, yogurt and fruit. There was also a tasty and well priced bar menu with pizza, chicken wings, loaded fries etc which was ideal after a day sightseeing. The lobby and bar area was very comfortable and relaxed with fun and stylish decor.
The hotel was 30 mins bus ride from the airport and stopped less than 2 mins walk from the hotel. The location was perfect 15 mins walk from the Edinburgh Castle, all the other attractions, shopping, bars and restaurants. Very central but yet in a nice quite part of the St.Andrews square. We couldn't not find fault with this hotel, we stayed for 4 days and highly recommend it and will definitely be back again. Excellent value.Stayed in February 2022",Lesley,8.0
